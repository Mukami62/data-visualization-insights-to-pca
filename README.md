**Human Resources (HR Dataset)
This repository explores an HR Dataset through data visualization techniques to uncover insights, followed by applying Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and deeper understanding.

***Project Overview***

Performed data cleaning (handled missing values, dropped identifiers, scaled numeric features).

Visualized key variables (salary, absences, engagement, satisfaction, performance).

Applied PCA to reduce high-dimensional data and analyzed explained variance.

Created PCA biplots to interpret variable loadings.

Compared K-Means clustering results on original vs PCA-reduced data.

***Methods Implemented***

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots and correlations.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

Clustering (K-Means) before and after PCA.

***Results***

Engagement and satisfaction condensed into one main component.

Absences contributed strongly to a separate component.

PCA improved clustering separation by performance score.

2D PCA plots provided clearer insights into employee grouping.

***Future Work***

Extend PCA to include more HR-related features (e.g., years of work, department).

Experiment with alternative dimensionality reduction methods (t-SNE).

Build an interactive dashboard for HR decision-making.
